# *Convolution*

### Basically convolution refers to a signal or function that represents, by how much two signals or functions interact with each other.

#### Convolution operation can be of n-dimensional, i.e. linear, 2D,3D....

#### Here with reference to the neural network, first layer of input data is one function and the kernel/filter is second function. Both of these convolute to give the second layer of neural network. 

#### Also,Convolution can be imagined as a process of adding each element of image to its local neighbor's.





# Filters/Kernels 

### A kernel(filter) is a function or matrix with particular values which is applied to the image, i.e Convoluted with the values of the image to obtain a unique output.

#### With reference to image processing the filters are defined to extract only particular kind of feature from an image. Filter can be related to second function in the operation of convolution above.

# Epochs

### An Epoch can be defined as one complete training cycle on the training set.

#### With reference to the training a neural network, if the network is trained on every training sample in one pass then it is considered as one epoch is completed. Multiple iterations of epochs is done to change the weights of the neurons in every layer.

#### In the above fig, if values of hidden layer and  output layer is changed including the backpropagation once then one epoch.



# 1*1 Convolution 

### 1*1 refers to the size of the filter(kernel) being applied on the test image. Since the filter size is 1, it simply maps an single input pixel with all its components to an output pixel by not relating to the pixels around it.

#### With reference to neural networks 1*1 convolution is mostly used to reduce the depth of the preceding layer rather then the size of layer.It mostly concentrates on the single color rather then colors surroundings it.

# 3*3 Convolution

### Again 3*3 refers to the size of the filter applied on the image. Since the filter size is 9, it maps 9 pixel values at a time for a particular feature. It is sum of product corresponding to value of pixel in test sample. Then the pixel position is shifted by 1 and filter is applied to next 9 values and so on.

#### 3*3 filter is used mostly because 5 *5,7 *7 and higher kernels can be built using 3 *3.

#### Every time 3*3 filter is applied on a layer the size of the layer decreases by a factor of 2 in both length and width.

# Feature Map

### It basically is the output value of the convolution operation between the filter and the test sample.

#### In neural networks every layer of neurons is an feature map for the preceding layer.And the output is final feature map of the neural network. And each of this feature map represents a unique feature with respect to the the filter applied.

# Feature engineering 

### Feature engineering refers to the process of converting the data available as test samples into features that represent the problem to the predictive models that results in better analyzation of unseen data.

#### The steps involved in feature engineering would be deciding features, creating, checking how the feature fits with the model and iterate until the feature works perfectly.

#### It can be considered the process is presently replaced by neural networks.





# $Bonus$

# Activation function

#### Activation function can be considered as an transfer function applied for neuron at the end that converts the value of each neuron to a specific value mostly between 0-1 or -1 to -1. 

#### Different types of activation functions used are sigmoid, Relu, tanh,softmax.

# Creating Github account



### You can store a variety of projects in GitHub repositories, including open source projects that you can share code to make better, more reliable software.

##### Follow this link to create the github account: https://github.com/ 

#### Select the (Signup for Github) after entering the username,email and password. Then  

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click , and then click **New repository**.

2. Type a short name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".

3. Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."

4. Choose to make the repository either public or private. Public repositories are visible to the public, while private repositories are only accessible to you, and people you share them with. For more information, see "[Setting repository visibility](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-repository-visibility)."

5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.

6. Click **Create repository**.

# Receptive Field. 

#### When dealing with high-dimensional inputs such as images, it is impractical to connect neurons to all neurons in the previous volume. Instead, we connect each neuron to only a local region of the input volume. The spatial extent of this connectivity is a hyperparameter called the **receptive field** of the neuron
